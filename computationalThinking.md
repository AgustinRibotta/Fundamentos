# Computational thinking

Designing or solving different type of problems, based on four pillars:

## 1. Decomposition

Breaking down a problem into smaller problems.

## 2. Pattern recognition

See  what things are repeated or can be repeated.

## 3. Abstraction

Limit to the fewest possible variables.

## 4. Algorithm

A set of ordered and defined interactions to solve a problem or perform a specific task.
