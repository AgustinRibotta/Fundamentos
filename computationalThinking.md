# Computational thinking

Designing or solving different type of problems, based on four pillars:

1. Decomposition

Breaking down a problem into smaller problems.

2. Pattern recognition

See  what things are repeated or can be repeated.

3. Abstraction

Limit to the fewest possible variables.

4. Algorithm

A set of ordered and defined interactions to solve a problem or perform a specific task.

## Tools

### - Flowcharts

Representation of the problem that allows visualizing the possible paths and how the problem can be solved.

### - Pseudocode
        
- Basic structures
    - Variables
    - Data types (primitive vs. complex)
    - Operators (arithmetic, logical, relational)
    - Conditionals (if, else, switch)
    - Loops (for, while, do-while)

- Data Structures
    - Arrays
    - List
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Maps / Dictionaries
