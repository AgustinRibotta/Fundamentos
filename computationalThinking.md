# Computational thinking

Designing or solving different type of problems, based on four pillars:

1. Decomposition

Breaking down a problem into smaller problems.

2. Pattern recognition

See  what things are repeated or can be repeated.

3. Abstraction

Limit to the fewest possible variables.

4. Algorithm

A set of ordered and defined interactions to solve a problem or perform a specific task.

## Tools

### - Flowcharts

Representation of the problem that allows visualizing the possible paths and how the problem can be solved.

### - Pseudocode
        
- Basic structures
    
    - Variables -> The value stored in memory location and the identifier (name) used to reference that location.

    - Data types (primitive vs. complex) -> represent simple value - Structure tht goup multiple values or data.

    - Operators (arithmetic, logical, relational) -> +, -, *, /, % - and , or , not - ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

    - Conditionals -> if, else, switch
    
    - Loops -> for, while, do-while

- Data Structures (complex)
    - Arrays -> []
    - List -> []
    - Stacks -> LIFO (Last in, First out) [] 
    - Queues -> FIFO (Firs in, First out) []
    - Maps / Dictionaries -> {key: value}
